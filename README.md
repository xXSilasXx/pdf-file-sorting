# pdf-file-sorting - python
In this repository you can find an explained customizable program that splits a huge pdf into single papers, concatenatesthe original pages together and then sends the files into the correct folder or creates a new one in case there is not one yet.

The setup is as follows:
You need to have 'split.py' in one directory and then you create two other directories within the directory with split.py in it. In the latter one of the  directories you place 'sort and distribute.py'.

Change the corresponding paths within the program. Then run it and your contracts will be either put into their respective directories or have a new directory established for them which will either be sent to the right destination or the directory with contracts and the greeting letter will be sent to the directory where 'sort and distribute.py' is not in.
